## _**Introduction:**_

An effective trading strategy is essential in attempting to sustain a living as a retail trader. It is without a doubt challenging, but exciting at the same time. The most consistent way to avoid becoming an all too familiar statistical loser in the stock market includes a necessary combination of advanced strategy, risk management, discipline, money management, emotional intelligence and the proper computational tools. In the end, the trader's success depends on the proven, straight forward strategy that is flexible enough to be effective for any security that meets the criteria.

No matter which strategy is chosen, the success or failure truly depends on three main components that can't be ignored:

* **Volume -** The volume informs us as to how much the instrument has been traded in the focused period. Elevated volume speaks to the significant change in interest for the asset or security. Usually (EDA focus), an increase in this metric will educate the informed trader that an impending price jump is approaching, price movement up or down doesn't matter, we can capitalize.

* **Volatility -** You can forecast the potential profit range based on historical volatility. Assuming that the price movement will move in a similar manner, following support and resistance, or trend lines from the past.  However, elevated volatility will not only impact your profit potential, the traders risk potential is greater at the same time.  Whiplash or reversals can eat away profits very fast in a volatile market.

and last, but certianly not least:

* **Liquidity -** Liquidity enables the quick movement in and out of a position.  A traders edge often depends on small price deltas, a lot of that can be lost if a large spread exists between the bid and ask.  This happens from a lack of liquidity. Profits erode quickly if an asset or security is illiquid, preventing the trader from executing at a desired price.  Settling for the much lower bid, or much high ask!

Before we drown ourselves in the complexity that is the world of highly technical indicators, our EDA will focus on the basics.  Often people think the basics aren't enough to improve upon the current win-ratio. I am here to argue that a focused incorporation of invaluable elements will accomplish just that. We will let exploratory data analysis and automated processes do the heavy lifting in the technicals, then we focus on discipline and emotional intelligence for the win.
